# hello-world
I am a young and aspiring programmer who is just starting out and discovering the ropes. I am currently affluent in C# and JavaScript. 
I hope to increase that number of languages to more than two in the near future.
With me programmer this early on, I hope to be able to get a job easier than I would if I don't do this
